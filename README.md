## Implementing Your First Game

Let's walk through implementing the Tower of Hanoi example, as it's the simplest game that demonstrates the core concepts:

```dart
class TowerOfHanoi extends HookWidget {
  // Number of disks to include in the game
  final int amount;

  const TowerOfHanoi({super.key, this.amount = 4});

  // Initialize the game state with all disks in the first column
  // Each disk is represented by a number, where larger numbers represent larger disks
  List<List<int>> get initialCards => [
    // First column contains all disks, largest (amount) to smallest (1)
    List.generate(amount, (i) => amount - i),
    // Second and third columns start empty
    <int>[],
    <int>[],
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Use Flutter Hooks to manage the state of our columns
    // Each column is a list of integers representing the disks
    final cardsState = useState(initialCards);

    return CardGame<int, int>(
      // Use the built-in numeric card style to render our disks as numbers
      style: numericCardStyle(),
      children: [
        SafeArea(
          child: Column(
            children: [
              Row(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
                children: cardsState.value
                    .mapIndexed((i, states) => CardColumn<int, int>(
                  // Each column needs a unique identifier
                  value: i,
                  // The cards (disks) currently in this column
                  values: states,
                  // Only allow moving one disk at a time
                  maxGrabStackSize: 1,
                  // Define the rules for when a disk can be placed here
                  canMoveCardHere: (move) {
                    final movingCard = move.cardValues.last;
                    final movingOnto = states.lastOrNull;
                    // Allow moves if:
                    // 1. Column is empty (movingOnto == null)
                    // 2. Moving disk is smaller than the top disk
                    return movingOnto == null || movingCard < movingOnto;
                  },
                  // Handle the actual movement of cards between columns
                  onCardMovedHere: (move) {
                    // Create a copy of the current state
                    final newCards = [...cardsState.value];
                    // Remove the moving card from its original column
                    // Since maxGrabStackSize is 1, we know we're only removing one card
                    newCards[move.fromGroupValue].removeLast();
                    // Add the moved card to its new column
                    // We use move.cardValues.first because maxGrabStackSize: 1 ensures
                    // there's exactly one card being moved at a time
                    newCards[i].add(move.cardValues.first);
                    // Update the state, triggering a rebuild
                    cardsState.value = newCards;
                  },
                ))
                    .toList(),
              ),
              Spacer(),
              // Reset button to start the game over
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () => cardsState.value = initialCards,
                style: ButtonStyle(
                    shape: WidgetStatePropertyAll(CircleBorder())),
                child: Icon(Icons.restart_alt),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This implementation shows:
1. Using numeric cards with the built-in `numericCardStyle()`
2. Setting up three columns using `CardColumn`
3. Implementing drag-and-drop rules with `canMoveCardHere`
4. Managing state with Flutter Hooks
5. Animating card movements automatically

### Running the Examples

To try out the examples:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the example directory
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Run `flutter run` and select the example you want to try

## Getting Started

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  card_game: ^1.0.0
```

## Core Concepts

### Card Types

The package uses two generic types:
- `T`: The type of your cards (e.g., `SuitedCard` for playing cards or `int` for numeric cards)
- `G`: The type for group identifiers (can be any type, often `dynamic`, `String`, or `int`)

### Card Groups

Three types of card groups are available:

1. `CardDeck`: Shows only the top card, useful for draw piles
2. `CardRow`: Displays cards horizontally with customizable spacing
3. `CardColumn`: Displays cards vertically with customizable spacing

### Card Styles

Built-in styles:
- `deckCardStyle()`: Renders standard playing cards with a red back
- `numericCardStyle()`: Renders numeric cards

Custom styles can be created by implementing `CardGameStyle<T>`.

## Customization

### Card Movement Rules

Control card movement with the following parameters:

```dart
CardColumn<T, G>(
  // ... other params
  canCardBeGrabbed: (index, card) => true, // Control which cards can be grabbed
  maxGrabStackSize: 1, // Limit how many cards can be grabbed at once
  canMoveCardHere: (moveDetails) => true, // Define rules for accepting cards
  onCardMovedHere: (moveDetails) {}, // Handle successful moves
)
```

### Card Interaction and Appearance

Control card interaction and visual state:

```dart
CardColumn<T, G>(
  // ... other params
  onCardPressed: (card) {
    // Handle card press events
    // Useful for flipping cards, selecting cards, or triggering game actions
  },
  isCardFlipped: (index, card) {
    // Control whether specific cards are shown face-down
    // Return true to show the card's back, false to show its face
    return shouldCardBeFlipped(index, card);
  },
)
```

Common use cases:
- Memory Match: Use `onCardPressed` to flip cards when clicked
- Solitaire: Use `isCardFlipped` to hide cards in the tableau
- War: Use `isCardFlipped` with `CardDeck.flipped` for face-down draw piles

### Custom Card Styles

Create your own card style:

```dart
CardGameStyle<MyCard>(
  cardSize: Size(64, 89),
  cardBuilder: (card, isFlipped, state) => MyCustomCard(
    card: card,
    isFlipped: isFlipped,
    state: state,
  ),
  emptyGroupBuilder: (state) => MyCustomEmptySpace(state: state),
)
```

## Tips

- Each card value (`T`) must be unique within the game
- Each group value (`G`) must be unique within the game
- Always explicitly specify type parameters for CardGroups to match the parent CardGame. For example, if you have `CardGame<SuitedCard, String>`, your groups should be `CardColumn<SuitedCard, String>`, `CardRow<SuitedCard, String>`, or `CardDeck<SuitedCard, String>`. This helps prevent type errors and makes the code more maintainable
- Use [flutter_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) or your preferred state management solution
- Changes to card positions and flips are automatically animated
- Card states (regular, highlighted, error) are handled automatically during drag and drop by default
